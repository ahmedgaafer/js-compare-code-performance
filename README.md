# js-compare-code-performance

a repo to test similar Classes, functions to see which one will perform better

This code was tested on the [code spaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

## Machine specs:

- **RAM**: 8GB
- **CPU CORES**: 8 Cores
- **Node**: v16.17.0

## How the performance was tested:

1 - a [higher order function ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/higher-order-functions-in-javascript/) was created to calculate the performance of a given function and returns the value of time

You can view it from [withCalculateTime.js](./withCaculateTime.js)

2 - Create a function for competing sides that performs the action in a for loop

3 - calculate and preserve the values of the result on different input quantities

## Comparisons:

- [Map VS Object](./mapVSobject/results/result.md)
